# ImagePlus

### NOTE: This mod doesn't do anything by itself and is meant to be used by other mods or texture packs.

## About

This mod allows developers and texture pack creators to use additional image formats like:

- WebP
- JPEG XL
- GIF
- QOI

It supports both static images and animated ones, without the need for additional code (you can use this with CCSprite
or even geode::LazySprite without any issues).

## For Developers

This mod has an API that allows you to decode images directly into RGBA buffers, as well as encode them back to various
formats.

It also provides a way to control the playback of animated images, allowing you to pause, stop, resume and control the
playback speed of animated images.
